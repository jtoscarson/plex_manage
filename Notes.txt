If the movie is missing the height and width in the database table: media_items, then that is indicitive of the movie not being analyized. 

Check aladdin: id: 35476

It should not be found.

So if the item ID is not in the table metadata_items than the item is not matched properly.


SELECT title
FROM external_metadata_items
WHERE title NOT LIKE ""
AND id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM metadata_items)
